                                    <p>CDN offers great, affordable and honest technology services. They were an integral addition to our in house team for special projects. The engineers we worked with are knowledgeable and flexible. We worked together on system design, user experience design, and execution. They were great at collaborating with our existing team. Even though they are providing support at an agency level. The communicate and project cadence was as effective as building an internal team. I would highly recommend working with them on large and small projects.</p>

                                    <p> So I guess the thing churned that has always impressed me about CDN is that I've been to a lot of other places in India and been to a lot of other companies in Baroda, chennai and I've decided in the end to work with CDN and because it's a company that meets my needs and my needs are not just development needs are like where the people that I'm working with can extract from me what i want but more than that they can take my ideas and taken further so it becomes more than just a development team, a team that actually starts to push my thinking and my ideas further and I think that's a wonderful thing in CDN.</p>

He and his team's diligence and flexibility was critical to the launch and success of the project. Our client NYSE was extremely happy with the work and we couldn't have done it without the excellent work done and managed by the team. I would recommend him and his team as a technical solution to any of my colleagues.</p>
